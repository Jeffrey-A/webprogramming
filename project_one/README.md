Run Integration test  

./node_modules/.bin/cypress open  

What I have a done:  
-Add CSS styling beyond what is required
-Write five unit tests
-Write two integration tests
-Deploy your project to a live URL
-Your CSS styling is mobile-first
-Have a Pull Request in the github repo history (beyond the pull request you use to submit)
-install & use eslint on your project


How to:
run unit test --> npm test
run integration test --> npm run cypress:open
